### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I`m Marcus Furletti, a multi-disciplined front-end developer with a balance of creativity, technology and management. 

Iâ€™m most motivated when collaborating to solve tough problems, build a better environment and deliver delightful customer experiences. 

I fell in love with Web Development because of the constant exposure to new challenges and opportunities to learn new things. Iâ€™m always studying and reading as much as possible.

Graduated in Business management at IBMEC (Brazilian Institute of Capital Market).
